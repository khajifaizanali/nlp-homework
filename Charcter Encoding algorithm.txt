Write up on character encoding algorithm.
Ans:-The algorithm must first train/model with the current encoding systems to know the byte ranges for looking the valid character. The algorithm also should be trained to know byte ranges which are unlikely to appear in encoding. The algorithm builds the byte range in file to know which byte ranges appear in file. The algorithm compares the byte ranges with known encoding  to predict the encoding scheme of file.UTF-8,ISO-8859 and many more are some of encoding algorithms. Charcter distribution and 2-Char sequence distribution are some encoding detection methods.
